                    Lastly, it's important to discuss the information with loved ones or people you know well.
                    The best way for you and others to learn about what trustworthy information is typically social interactions or anecdotes from others,
                    rather than experts. Now this isn't to say that you shouldn't listen to experts, but more to spread the word of the experts.
                </p>
                <p>In trying times like a worldwide pandemic or the hot climate of politics, it's important that the information that everyone recieves is trustworthy to be safe and authentic. Which is why misinformation is such a dangerous threat to our society
