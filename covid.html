            <h1>Covid-19: An example of viral misinformation</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic was a very confusing and dyanmic time, with the very limited infromation we had
                obscured by tons of misinformation.
            </p>
            <p>Actually, a lot of the viral misinformation that spread around the internet, were started by just a few people!</p>
            <h2>The "dirty dozen" of misinformation</h2>
            <p>In a report done by the center for countering digital hate, their analysis of anti-vax content posted or shared to Facebook 689,000 times shows that 73% of that content originates from only a dozen influencers.</p>
            <p>These influencers give claims such as "Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine had killed more people than the disease itself.", or that "the pandemic is an excuse for governments to control the population through a 'blanket of tyranny'"</p>
            <p>This kind of misinformation was extremely dangerous, discouraging people to take the potentially life saving vaccine</p>
            <p>And part of the issue with this kind of misinformation, is that it's promoted through engagement on social media. In research conducted by the CCDH in 2020, social media platforms
                failed to act on 95% of the COVID-19 and vaccine misinformation that was reported.
            </p>
            <h2>Frontline Doctors</h2>
            <p>Groups like "America's Frontline Doctors" also rose to discuss the "truth" about COVID-19 in a self-described "White Coat Summit". The group had a 45-minute
                long event online that was held on the footsteps of the D.C. courthouse, which was pulled from social media for spreading misinformation
                and unproven treatments for COVID-19. These white coated people had no credentials to back up their claims, but proved harmful to the public view due to the
                legitimate nature the white coat and strong, unsubstantial claims.
